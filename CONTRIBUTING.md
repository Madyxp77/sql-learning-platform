cd sql-learning-platform
(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username).Set Upstream Remote: Add the original repository as an "upstream" remote to easily pull in future changes:git remote add upstream https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_OF_ORIGINAL_REPO/sql-learning-platform.git
(Replace YOUR_USERNAME_OF_ORIGINAL_REPO with the actual username or organization name of the main project repository).Install Live Server (VS Code): If you're using Visual Studio Code (highly recommended for this project):Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey and install it. This will allow you to run the project locally with live reloading.Local Development:Open the sql-learning-platform folder in VS Code.Right-click on index.html in the Explorer pane and select Open with Live Server.Your project will open in your default browser, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5500/ or http://localhost:5500/.Making ChangesCreate a New Branch: Always create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name:git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/doc-improvement
Implement Your Changes: Write your code, update content, or make your improvements. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards (e.g., modular JavaScript, semantic HTML, efficient CSS).Test Your Changes: Before committing, thoroughly test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce new issues.Commit Your Changes: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.Good Commit Message Example: feat: Add interactive SQL editor to chapter pagesBad Commit Message Example: fix or changesgit add .
git commit -m "type: Your descriptive commit message"
Commit Message Convention (Recommended): Use Conventional Commits for consistent history:feat: A new featurefix: A bug fixdocs: Documentation only changesstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a featureperf: A code change that improves performancetest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing testsbuild: Changes that affect the build system or external dependenciesci: Changes to CI configuration files and scriptschore: Other changes that don't modify src or test filesrevert: Reverts a previous commitPush to Your Fork: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:git push origin your-branch-name
Create a Pull Request (PR):Go to your forked repository on GitHub.You should see a "Compare & pull request" button or similar. Click it.Fill out the pull request template:Title: A concise summary of your changes (e.g., feat: Implement dark theme toggle).Description: Explain the problem your PR solves, how it solves it, any relevant context, and how to test it.Reference any issues it closes (e.g., Closes #123).Submit the pull request.Code StandardsHTML: Use semantic HTML5 elements. Ensure proper indentation and avoid inline styles.CSS:Use custom properties (CSS variables) for colors, fonts, and common values.Prefer Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.Ensure responsiveness with media queries (mobile-first approach).Keep CSS modular and organized.JavaScript:Use ES6+ features.Organize code into modules (.js files with export/import).Write clear, concise, and well-commented code.Handle errors gracefully.Avoid global variables where possible.Content Standards (for Chapter and Exercise files)SQL Queries: Ensure all SQL queries are correct, runnable, and adhere to standard SQL syntax (with notes for dialect variations if critical).Clarity: Explanations should be clear, concise, and easy for beginners to understand.Accuracy: All technical information and examples must be accurate.Consistency: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting throughout the content.Review ProcessOnce you submit a pull request, project maintainers will review your changes.We may ask for clarifications or suggest modifications. Please be responsive to feedback.Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.Thank you for contributing to "The SQL Path"! Your efforts help build a valuable resource for aspiring data analysts.
