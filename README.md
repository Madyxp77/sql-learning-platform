Local DevelopmentTo set up and run the project locally:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sql-learning-platform.git
cd sql-learning-platform
Serve the files with Visual Studio Code (Recommended):Open the sql-learning-platform folder in Visual Studio Code.If you don't have it, install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.Once installed, right-click on index.html in the Explorer pane and select Open with Live Server.This will launch the application in your default browser, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5500/ or http://localhost:5500/, and provide live reloading as you make changes to your files.Alternative Local Servers (if not using VS Code):Using Python's http.server:python -m http.server 8000
Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.Using Node.js http-server (if Node.js is installed):# Install globally if you don't have it
npm install -g http-server
# Run from the project root
http-server -p 8000
Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.Testing before deployment:Always test your changes thoroughly on your local development server across different browsers and screen sizes before pushing to GitHub to ensure everything functions as expected.Deployment & Go-Live InstructionsThis section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for deploying and managing "The SQL Path" on GitHub Pages.Repository Setup & Deployment:GitHub Repository Creation:Go to GitHub and log in.Click the + icon in the top right corner and select New repository.Set Repository name: sql-learning-platformChoose Public.Do NOT check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license" here, as we will be pushing our pre-made files.Click Create repository.Follow the instructions on the next page to push an existing local repository (our project structure) to this new GitHub repository. From your sql-learning-platform local directory in your terminal:git init -b main # Initializes a new git repository and sets the default branch to 'main'
git add .        # Stages all files in the current directory
git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up project structure for SQL Learning Platform" # Commits staged changes
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sql-learning-platform.git # Connects your local repo to the GitHub repo
git push -u origin main # Pushes your 'main' branch to GitHub
(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username).GitHub Pages Configuration:Once your code is pushed, go to your GitHub repository on the web.Click on Settings (usually near the top right).In the left sidebar, click on Pages.Under "Source," select Deploy from a branch.For "Branch," select main (or master if you used that default) and choose the /(root) folder.Click Save.GitHub Pages will now deploy your site. It might take a few minutes. Once deployed, the URL will be shown on this page (e.g., https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sql-learning-platform/).Custom Domain Setup (Optional): If you wish to use a custom domain (e.g., sqlpath.yourdomain.com), enter it in the "Custom domain" field. You will then need to configure your DNS records with your domain registrar.DNS Configuration (CNAME): You'll typically need to add a CNAME record pointing your custom subdomain (sqlpath) to YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.SSL Certificate Configuration: GitHub Pages automatically provisions a free SSL certificate for custom domains. After setting up your custom domain and DNS, check the "Enforce HTTPS" box on the GitHub Pages settings page.Automated Deployment Setup (GitHub Actions):To automate deployment so that every push to main updates your live site, we'll set up a GitHub Actions workflow.Create a directory .github/workflows/ in your project root.Inside this directory, create a file named deploy.yml (or similar).Content for .github/workflows/deploy.yml:name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger the workflow on pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Action to checkout your repository code

    - name: Setup Node.js (if you need npm/yarn for build steps, e.g., Monaco)
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20' # Specify Node.js version

    # Add any build or optimization steps here if you decide to add them later
    # For a truly static site, this might just involve copying files.
    # For Monaco Editor or other JS libraries, you might run 'npm install'
    # and then copy the necessary build artifacts.
    - name: Install dependencies (if any)
      run: |
        # Example: If you decide to manage JS libraries via npm in the future
        # npm install

    - name: Build site (if applicable)
      run: |
        # Example: If you have a build script
        # npm run build
        echo "No specific build step for pure static HTML/CSS/JS yet."


    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 # Action for deploying to GitHub Pages
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Automatically provided token
        publish_dir: ./ # Directory to publish (your project root in this case)
        # For custom domain, ensure this is set correctly.
        # cname: yourdomain.com # Uncomment and replace if using a custom domain.
Commit and push this .github/workflows/ directory to your main branch. GitHub Actions will detect the workflow and run it. You can monitor its progress under the "Actions" tab in your repository.Go-Live Checklist:Pre-Launch Testing:Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and ensure consistent appearance and functionality.Mobile Responsiveness Verification: Thoroughly test on various mobile devices and tablet sizes, both in portrait and landscape modes. Use browser developer tools' device emulation.Performance Optimization Checks: Use Google Lighthouse (available in Chrome DevTools) to audit performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Address any critical warnings.Accessibility Audits: Beyond Lighthouse, manually check for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast.Content Review: Proofread all text for accuracy, grammar, and clarity. Ensure all SQL examples and exercises are correct and runnable.Deployment Process:Once your changes are tested and ready, simply push them to your main branch:git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Ready for launch: Final pre-deployment checks and content updates"
git push origin main
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger, build (if any build steps are added), and deploy your updated site to GitHub Pages.Post-Launch Monitoring:Regularly check your GitHub Pages site to ensure it's live and functional.Monitor GitHub Actions runs for any deployment failures.Use browser developer tools' Console and Network tabs to identify any runtime errors or failed asset loads on the live site.ContributingWe welcome contributions!
