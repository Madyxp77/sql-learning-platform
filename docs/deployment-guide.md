Deployment & Go-Live Instructions for The SQL Path LMSThis guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for deploying and managing "The SQL Path: Interactive Learning Platform" on GitHub Pages.Repository Setup & Deployment:1. GitHub Repository Creation:Go to GitHub: Navigate to github.com and log in to your account.Create a New Repository: Click the + icon in the top right corner (or the "New" button on your profile page) and select New repository.Configure Repository Details:Repository name: Enter sql-learning-platform.Public/Private: Choose Public (GitHub Pages works best with public repositories).Initialization Options: DO NOT check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license" here, as your local project already contains these files.Create Repository: Click the Create repository button.2. Push Your Local Project to GitHub:After creating the empty repository on GitHub, you'll be shown instructions to push an existing local repository. From your sql-learning-platform local directory in your terminal (e.g., PowerShell, Git Bash, macOS Terminal):# 1. Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder and set the default branch to 'main'
git init -b main

# 2. Stage all files in the current directory for the first commit
git add .

# 3. Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up project structure for SQL Learning Platform"

# 4. Connect your local repository to the new GitHub repository
#    Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sql-learning-platform.git

# 5. Push your 'main' branch to GitHub. The '-u' flag sets the upstream,
#    so future 'git push' commands are simpler.
git push -u origin main
(Remember to replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.)3. GitHub Pages Configuration:Once your code is pushed to the main branch, you can enable GitHub Pages:Navigate to Repository Settings: Go to your sql-learning-platform repository on GitHub (in your web browser).Access Pages Settings: Click on the Settings tab (usually near the top right, below the repository name). In the left sidebar, click on Pages.Configure Deployment Source:Under "Source," ensure Deploy from a branch is selected.For "Branch," select main (or master if you used that default) from the dropdown.Ensure the folder dropdown is set to /(root).Save Changes: Click the Save button.GitHub Pages will now start deploying your site. This process might take a few minutes. Once the deployment is complete, the URL where your site is live will be displayed on this Pages settings page (e.g., https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sql-learning-platform/).4. Custom Domain Setup (Optional):If you own a custom domain (e.g., sqlpath.yourdomain.com) and wish to use it instead of the default GitHub Pages URL:Enter Custom Domain: In the GitHub Pages settings, under the "Custom domain" section, enter your desired custom domain (e.g., sqlpath.yourdomain.com).Configure DNS Records: You will then need to configure your DNS records with your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare).For a subdomain (e.g., sqlpath.yourdomain.com): Add a CNAME record pointing your custom subdomain (sqlpath) to YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.For a root domain (e.g., yourdomain.com): You'll typically add A records pointing to GitHub Pages IP addresses. Refer to GitHub's official documentation on custom domains for the most up-to-date IP addresses.SSL Certificate Configuration: GitHub Pages automatically provisions a free SSL certificate for custom domains. After setting up your custom domain and DNS, return to the GitHub Pages settings and check the "Enforce HTTPS" box. This ensures your site is served securely via HTTPS.5. Automated Deployment Setup (GitHub Actions):To automate the deployment process so that every push to your main branch updates your live site, you can set up a GitHub Actions workflow:Create Workflow Directory: In your project root, create a directory named .github/workflows/.Create Workflow File: Inside this directory, create a new file named deploy.yml (or similar).Add Workflow Content: Copy and paste the following YAML content into .github/workflows/deploy.yml:# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger the workflow on pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner (e.g., ubuntu-latest)

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Action to checkout your repository code

    - name: Setup Node.js (if needed for build steps like Monaco Editor dependencies)
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20' # Specify Node.js version suitable for your environment

    # Optional: Add steps to install npm dependencies or build your project if applicable
    # - name: Install dependencies
    #   run: npm install
    # - name: Build site
    #   run: npm run build # If you have a build script defined in package.json

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 # Action for deploying to GitHub Pages
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Automatically provided token for authentication
        publish_dir: ./ # Specifies the directory to publish (your project root in this case)
        # Optional: Uncomment and replace if using a custom domain.
        # cname: yourdomain.com
Commit and Push Workflow: Commit this new .github/workflows/ directory and its contents to your main branch. GitHub Actions will automatically detect this workflow and run it on subsequent pushes to main. You can monitor the progress and logs of your deployments under the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.Go-Live Checklist:1. Pre-Launch Testing:Before deploying your latest changes to the live site, ensure thorough testing:Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test your application on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.Mobile Responsiveness Verification: Extensively test on various mobile devices and tablet sizes, both in portrait and landscape orientations. Utilize browser developer tools' device emulation for efficiency.Performance Optimization Checks: Use tools like Google Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools) to audit performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Address any critical warnings or suggestions.Accessibility Audits: Beyond automated tools, manually check for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility (if relevant), and sufficient color contrast.Content Review: Proofread all text content for accuracy, grammar, and clarity. Crucially, ensure all SQL examples and exercises are correct, runnable, and provide expected outputs within the interactive editor.2. Deployment Process:Once your changes are thoroughly tested and ready for public release, deploy them:Stage and Commit Changes:git add .
git commit -m "ðŸš€ Ready for launch: Final pre-deployment checks and content updates"
Push to Main Branch:git push origin main
The GitHub Actions workflow you configured will automatically trigger upon this push. It will build (if any build steps are added) and deploy your updated site to GitHub Pages.3. Post-Launch Monitoring:After your site is live, continuous monitoring is good practice:Regular Site Checks: Periodically visit your GitHub Pages site to ensure it's accessible and fully functional.Monitor GitHub Actions: Keep an eye on the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository for any deployment failures or warnings.Browser Developer Tools: Use the browser's Developer Tools (Console and Network tabs) on the live site to identify any runtime JavaScript errors, failed asset loads, or unexpected network behavior.This comprehensive guide should equip you with the knowledge to deploy and maintain "The SQL Path" on GitHub Pages effectively!
