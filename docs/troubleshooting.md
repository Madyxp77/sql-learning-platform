Troubleshooting Guide for The SQL Path LMSThis guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter while developing or deploying "The SQL Path: Interactive Learning Platform."Local Development Issues1. Live Server Not Working / Browser Not OpeningIssue: Open with Live Server in VS Code doesn't open a browser, or the page doesn't load.Solution:Check Live Server extension: Ensure the Live Server extension is correctly installed and enabled in VS Code.Port Conflict: Another application might be using port 5500.VS Code: Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Settings on macOS), search for "Live Server settings.port", and change it to a different port (e.g., 5501, 8080).Terminal: If using Python or Node.js servers, try a different port: python -m http.server 8001 or http-server -p 8001.Firewall: Your firewall might be blocking the port. Temporarily disable it or add an exception for your chosen port.Check Console: Open your browser's developer console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) for any error messages.2. CSS/JavaScript Files Not Loading (404 Errors)Issue: Your page loads, but styles are missing, or JavaScript functionality doesn't work. Browser console shows "404 (Not Found)" errors for CSS/JS files.Solution:Pathing: Double-check the paths in your index.html (e.g., <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">, <script src="assets/js/main.js"></script>). Ensure they accurately reflect the file structure you've created. Remember paths are case-sensitive on some servers (including GitHub Pages).Typo: Verify there are no typos in the file names or directory names.File Existence: Make sure the files actually exist in the specified locations.3. SQL.js Database Initialization ErrorsIssue: The console shows errors like "Failed to load sql-wasm.wasm" or "Error initializing database."Solution:sql-wasm.wasm path: In assets/js/sql-engine.js (or database.js), ensure locateFile: file => \assets/js/${file}`correctly points to thesql-wasm.wasmfile relative to yourindex.html. If you put sql-wasm.jsandsql-wasm.wasmdirectly inassets/js/`, this path should be correct.SQL File Fetching: Check if schema.sql and insert_data.sql are being fetched correctly. Look for network errors (404) in your browser's network tab for these files.SQL Syntax: If db.run(schemaSql) or db.run(insertDataSql) throws an error, it usually means there's a syntax error in your SQL scripts (schema.sql or insert_data.sql). Carefully review the SQL content for missing semicolons, incorrect keywords, or mismatched column/table names. SQLite.js will report the specific SQL error.File Encoding: Ensure your SQL files are saved with UTF-8 encoding.4. Monaco Editor Not LoadingIssue: The code editor area is blank, or errors related to Monaco Editor appear in the console.Solution:Loader Path: Ensure the path to vs/loader.js in your code-editor.js (or wherever you initialize Monaco) is correct. It typically looks like: require.config({ paths: { 'vs': 'assets/js/monaco-editor/min/vs' } });Monaco Files: Verify that all Monaco Editor files (vs directory) are correctly placed under assets/js/monaco-editor/min/.CSP (Content Security Policy) - if applicable: If you later implement a CSP, ensure it allows loading scripts from 'blob:' or 'data:' URIs if Monaco uses them, and allows eval for worker scripts. For a static site on GitHub Pages, this is less common, but good to note.GitHub Pages Deployment Issues1. Site Not Updating After PushIssue: You push changes to GitHub, but the live GitHub Pages site doesn't reflect them.Solution:Cache: Your browser or CDN cache might be serving old content.Hard Refresh: Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+R on macOS).Clear Browser Cache: Clear your browser's cache for the site.Service Worker: If a service worker (your sw.js) is active, it might be serving cached content. You may need to:Increment CACHE_NAME in sw.js (e.g., v1 to v2) and push the change.In Chrome DevTools (Application tab > Service Workers), unregister the service worker and clear all caches, then hard refresh.GitHub Pages Build Time: It can take a few minutes (sometimes up to 10-15 minutes for first deployments or large changes) for GitHub Pages to build and deploy. Check the "Actions" tab in your repository for the deployment workflow status.Incorrect Branch/Folder: In Repository Settings > Pages, ensure main (or master) branch is selected and the /(root) folder is chosen as the source.GitHub Actions Errors: If you have an automated deployment workflow, check the "Actions" tab for any failed workflow runs. Click on the failed run to see detailed logs.2. Custom Domain Not Working / SSL IssuesIssue: Your custom domain isn't redirecting, or you see "Not Secure" warnings/errors.Solution:DNS Configuration: Verify your DNS records with your domain registrar.For CNAME records: Ensure the subdomain points to YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.For A records (root domains): Ensure they point to the correct GitHub Pages IP addresses. DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate.GitHub Pages Settings: In Repository Settings > Pages, ensure your custom domain is correctly entered and the "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox is ticked. Give it some time after DNS changes for GitHub to provision the SSL certificate.CNAME file: For custom domains, GitHub Pages might require a CNAME file in the root of your repository containing only your custom domain (e.g., sqlpath.yourdomain.com). Your deploy.yml action should handle this via cname parameter if uncommented.3. Assets Not Loading on Live Site (e.g., assets/js/main.js 404)Issue: Similar to local 404s, but specific to the live GitHub Pages site.Solution:Case Sensitivity: GitHub Pages servers are case-sensitive. Ensure all file and folder names in your repository exactly match the casing used in your HTML, CSS, and JS paths. (e.g., assets/js/main.js is different from assets/JS/main.js). This is a very common issue.Root Relative Paths: Use root-relative paths starting with / (e.g., /assets/css/style.css) to ensure consistent loading regardless of the current URL path.Deployment Directory: In your GitHub Actions deploy.yml, ensure publish_dir: ./ correctly points to the root of your deployable site. If you have a build step that outputs to a dist or build folder, publish_dir should point to that (e.g., publish_dir: ./dist).General Debugging TipsUse Browser Developer Tools: The Console tab for JavaScript errors, Network tab for failed resource loads, Elements tab for HTML/CSS inspection, and Application tab for Service Worker and localStorage inspection are invaluable.Isolate the Problem: For complex issues, comment out sections of code or remove features until the problem disappears, then re-introduce them one by one to pinpoint the cause.Check Git Status: Ensure you've committed and pushed all your intended changes (git status, git add ., git commit, git push).Review GitHub Docs: The official GitHub Pages documentation is an excellent resource for specific configurations and troubleshooting.By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve most issues encountered during the development and deployment of your SQL Learning Management System.
